# Introduction

Bob is a "database-first" ORM. That means you must first create your database schema. Please use something like [sql-migrate](https://github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate) or some other migration tool to manage this part of the database's life-cycle.

There is also a generator for other schema definitions like [Atlas' schema](https://atlasgo.io/atlas-schema/sql-resources) and [Prisma's schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema).
